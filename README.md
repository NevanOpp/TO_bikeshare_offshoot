# TO_bikeshare_offshoot

Offshoot of private project used for analyzing bikeshare data. This takes uses mapbox/gbfs to find routes. It is a companion piece to schoolwork and should not be used on its own.

This repo is not an ongoing project, please email me: nevanopp@cmail.carleton.ca for more info if you want to work with this code further or more info about either API.

Thanks.
